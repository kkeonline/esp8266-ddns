Update DDNS using esp-01 + usb adaptor

If your router support limit DDNS provider and you want to use another free DDNS provider (such as Duckdns, Dynu)
You may think you have to turn on a PC or RPI 24 hours to update DDNS ip when your ip changed
another solution is to use a small and low power consuming ESP-01s board instread of using more power consuming like PC or RPI

Hardware:
1. ESP-01s
2. USB to ESP-01 Adaptor

Note: Jump GPIO0 to GND before power on ESP01 to enter Programming mode.
or use "ESP LINK" usb adaptor for auto switching into programming mode
